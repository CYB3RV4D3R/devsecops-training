**Welcome to the DevSecOps Course!**

DevSecOps is the abbreviation for development, security, and operations. It integrates security at every phase of the software development lifecycle from the design all the way to the delivery and continuous deployment.

Which leads to the second benefit of cost. Development teams delivering code faster leads to reduced costs. Lastly, security is a vital and crucial benefit of DevSecOps. Security is introduced at the very beginning of the development cycle.
